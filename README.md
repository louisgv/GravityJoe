# GravityJoe

## Developer
** If you see a README.md or README.txt please take a second to read it.**

## Scripting convention:

1. All script file must be in `UpperCamelCase.cs`
1. All method must be in `UpperCamelCase`
1. All mutable (can be changed) variable must be in `lowerCamelCase`
1. All constant variable must be in `UPPER_DASHED_CASE`
1. All fields/variables should be mindfully named. I.e, `GameObject mainCharacter = new GameObject()`. Do not afraid of long naming! This is so that other Dev can easily follow the code.

That's it folk, have fun!
